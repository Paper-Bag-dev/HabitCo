## HabitCo – Your Daily Habit Tracking Companion
📌 ### What is HabitCo?
HabitCo is a habit-tracking application that helps users build consistency by visualizing their progress over a 4-month block. Instead of just tracking whether a habit was completed, HabitCo provides state management features that allow users to log different habit statuses, such as:

✅ Completed
⚠️ Partially Done
❌ Missed

🔥 ### Core Features
4-Month Block Visualization – See all your habits at a glance with a heatmap-style grid that represents your consistency over time.
State Management – Instead of a binary system (done/not done), users can log progress with different states, making tracking more realistic.
Custom Habit Creation – Users can set daily/weekly goals, define priority levels, and categorize habits.
Streak & Performance Insights – Built-in analytics to highlight habit patterns, strengths, and weaknesses.
🚀 Future Vision – AI-Powered Sentiment Tracking
In the future, I plan to integrate AI-driven insights to enhance habit tracking with sentiment analysis and behavioral insights. This will take HabitCo beyond a basic tracking tool and make it a personalized habit coach.

🔹 Sentiment-Based Habit Tracking – AI will analyze user notes, input patterns, and external factors (like mood, time of day) to detect why a habit was missed or completed.
🔹 Smart Habit Recommendations – If a habit is struggling, HabitCo will suggest optimizations (e.g., shifting the time, adjusting difficulty, breaking it into smaller steps).
🔹 Predictive Streak Analysis – AI will forecast habit consistency based on past performance and provide alerts when a habit is at risk of breaking.
🔹 Mood & Productivity Correlation – Users can track their mental state alongside habits to understand how emotions impact productivity.

This AI-powered evolution will turn HabitCo into a self-improvement companion, offering actionable insights rather than just raw data. 🚀
